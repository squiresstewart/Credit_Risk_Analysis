# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to employ different machine learning techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, data is oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. A combinatorial of over- and undersampling is demonstrated in the SMOTEEN algorithm. Finally two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, are used to predict credit risk.

## Results: 

- describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models.

- There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)


## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
